											<h1>About me</h1>
										</header>
										<p>Hi there! 
										</p>
										
										<p>
											My name is Maria J. Anderson-Coto. I'm currently pursuing my doctoral degree in Informatics at University of California, Irvine.
										</p>
										<p>
											I research how people and communities see themselves represented in technologies, and co-create initiatives and tools that sustain their ways of knowing and being. </br>

											The pillars of my work are human-centered design methodologies, critical race theory, and justice-oriented pedagogies.   	
										</p>										
										 <p> 
											 My upcoming work lies in the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology & ethics, data analytics, participatory design methodologies, critical scholarship and culturally sustaining pedagogy. 
											I work alongside minoritized teens to explore perceptions and uses of AI to then critique, co-design and re-imagine equitable STEAM and AI-based initiatives, tools, and environments that strive toward just, culturally responsive and sustaining futures for them and their communities.</br>
										</p>
										
										<p> <strong> Skills, Languages, and stuff I might know about:</strong>  English, Spanish, Python, SQL, Tableau, Microsoft Office, Dedoose. I also know random facts about cats. </p>

									<h3> Playful Learning Landscapes companion mobile app </h3>
									<p> <strong> Role: </strong> UX researcher and qualitative data analyst. </br>
									<strong> Tasks: </strong> I participate in co-design sessions, usability testing, and created coding schemes from audio and drawings and transform them into cultrually sustaining design assets, direction, and feedback for the app design. </br>
									<strong> Methods:</strong> Participatory design, participant observation, qualitative data analysis (coding, thematic)</br>
									<strong> Institution(s): </strong> UCI + Santa Ana Early Learning Initiative (SAELI) </br>
									<strong> Stakeholders: </strong> SAELI, Santa Ana local government, parents and members of the Santa Ana community, HCI/educators, NSF </br>
									<strong> Challenges: </strong> 
										How can we expand access to our activities for youth who cannot go to the physical instalations in a way that sustains and reflect deep community's values? 
										How can we expand the proposed physical installations to provide a larger variety of activities and provide replayability?</br></p>
									<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
									<p>This project is an extension of a larger initiative, Playful Learning Landscapes, which reimagines public spaces as hubs for learning STEM through play.
										Using community-based, participatory design research and partnering with local community members from the Santa Ana Early Learning Initiative (SAELI),
										we are co-designing a cellphone application that allows children to interact further with the physical installations - both in-situ and online, not only providing 
										further engagement for youth who complete the activities in-person, but also 
										making our activities accessible for children who cannot visit the installations. 
										Right now, we are creating prototypes that reflect children's values, and the communtiy's ways of knowing and being. We're looking forward to testing the prototypes with the families soon!

									<h3>Youth Connections for Wellbeing</h3>
									<p><strong> Role: </strong> Researcher, Faciliator, Curriculum co-creator and Design instructor </br>
									<strong> Tasks: </strong> I co-designed the structure of the program, the curriculum, and co-faciliated the sessions where we taught and co-designed alongside Latine youth. I also co-created the interview protocol and executed interviews.</br>
									<strong> Methods: </strong> Participatory design, semi-strucured interviews, participant observation, culturally sustaining pedagogy, counterstory, qualitative data analysis </br>
									<strong> Institution(s): </strong> UCI + Listo America Clubhouse </br>
									<strong> Stakeholders: </strong> HCI reserachers and educators, Latine clubhouse, 11 youth, Pivotal Ventures</br>
									<strong> Challenge: </strong> Explore Latine's youth intersectional relationships between wellness and technology. What would a tool/idea that is tailored for their wellness and context look like? </br>
									<p><strong> Description </strong> </br>
									<p> Youth Connections for Wellbeing is a multi-stage project that explores youth's insights, agency, and technology engagements to support their wellbeing.
										Our stage focused on a participatory design project oriented towards teen digital wellness
										The curriculum is based on concepts of cultural responsiveness and community based design, and covered topics such as technology design techniques, 
										wellness, and cognitive behavioral principles. 
										We worked and learned with Latinx teenagers, ages 11-22, co-designing tools for wellness 
										using methods such as "design from within" (Anderson-Coto* & O'leary*, 2021), counter storytelling, and culturally susatining design. 

									<p> <strong> Outcomes: </strong> </p>
									<p> By the end of the program, the youth organized in groups, developed, and presented four designs of wellness tools, combining digital and non-digital elements that 
									centered on their own experiences and perceptions of wellbeing. Common threads throughout these designs such as 
									community, inclusion, and unique challenges faced by Latinx youth that gave us insight about their views on wellness and technology. 
									Part of the way through our program, Covid-19 forced us to our work from in-person to an online format. 
									This presented challenges, opportunities, and lessons for researchers on how to mantain participant engagement and a feeling of community, which we will address in upcoming work.

									<h3>Tenacity</h3>
									<p> <strong> Role: </strong> UX Researcher, facilitator, and qualitative data analysis.</br>
									<strong>Tasks:</strong> I coordinated a team of 8 graduate students and design interns. I co-designed and executed the interview porotocol, diary study, and surveys. 
										Analyzed qualiative data from diary studies, interviews/focus groups and provided design insights and feedback. 
										Tested each design before release, and supervised topics of inclusion and cultural awareness in design. </br>
									<strong> Methods:</strong> participatory design workshop, semi-structured interviews/focus groups, diary studies, surveys, qualitative data analysis </br>
									<strong> Institutions:</strong> UCI, 2 schools </br>
									<strong> Stakeholders: </strong> HCI reserachers and educators, teen youth, NSF, middle and high school teachers </br>
									<strong> Challenge: </strong> How do youth in early adolescence conceptualize self-regulation? How can we co-design a re-design of an app that captures their concept of self-regulation and that youth will use? </p>
									<p> <strong> Description: </strong> </p>
									<p> 
										This project uses participatory design methods to understand how wearable devices can support self-regulation in teens, 
										and re-design Tenacity, meditation-based application to be more responsive to the youth's needs.
										
										Tenacity consisted on two-parts.The first part is a participatory design workshop with 27 teens ages 11-14, from a intermediate school in Santa Ana,CA, 
										where the youth brainstormed and created ideas of tools that would aid them in self-regulation. 
										These designs were taken in by the design team to redesign the app. 
										The second part consists on a field deployment and design iteration, where youth tested the app for two weeks. 
										For the second part, we worked with 35 participants between the ages of 11-15 across two states. 
									</p>
										
									<p> <strong> Outcomes: </strong> </p>
									<p> We discovered that youth defined self-regulation as a tool instead of a skill, and had valuable and distinct design preferences, 
										which were incorporated into the final design.
										Youth responded positively to the re-deisgn wearable version in comparison to the previous application for ipad, resulting in higher 
										levels of satisfaction and use. 
										They also showed interest in some features for sharing achievements and competitive play, while having the priority option of mantaining their privacy. 
										We discovered three design tensions, which were central in shifting our perceptions of self-regulation to meet youth’s interests and practices.
