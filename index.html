											<h2>About me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello there! 
										</p>
										
										<p>
											I'm Maria J. Anderson-Coto. I am a critical scholar, doctoral student, and advocate. I'm currently pursuing my doctoral degree in Informatics at University of California, Irvine.
										</p>
										<p>
											My research examines the relationship between minoritized youth's intersectional identities and technology, education, and media.
											I work to empower minoritized youth and communities through critical co-design.
											The pillars of my work are human-centered design methodologies, critical race theory, and justice-oriented pedagogies. 											
										</p>
										<p>
											My latest research brings together machine learning, data analytics, design methodologies, education frameworks and team science. 
											I work alongside Latinx teens to co-design and create equitable STEAM-based tools and environments that strive toward just, culturally-sustaining, sustainable futures for them and their communities.
										</p>
											
										<p>
											My secondary line of work examines video game communities' perceptions and relationship with video game industry and institutions.

										<h3>Youth Connections for Wellbeing</h3>
										<p> Youth Connections for Wellbeing is a multi-stage project that explores digital strategies for youth online wellbeing.
											Our stage is a participatory design project oriented towards teen digital wellness which consisted on creating a co-design 
											curriculum, and facilitating the co-design sessions. 
											The curriculum is based on concepts of cultural responsiveness and community based design, and covered topics such as technology design techniques, 
											wellness, and cognitive behavioral principles. 
										</p>
										<p>
											We worked and learned with Latinx teenagers, ages 11-22, co-designing tools for wellness 
											using methods such as "design from within" (Anderson-Coto* & O'leary*, 2021), counter storytelling, and culturally responsive design. 
											By the end of the program, the group presented four designs of wellness tools, combining digital and non-digital elements.
											Part of the way through our program, Covid-19 forced us to our work from in-person to an online format. 
											This presented challenges, opportunities, and lessons on how to mantain participant engagement and a feeling of community, which we will address in upcoming work.

										<h3>Tenacity</h3>
										<p>This project is a participatody design research project to understand 
											how wearable devices can support self-regulation in teens, 
											and re-design a meditation-based application to be more responsive to the youth's needs. 
										</p>
										<p>	Tenacity consisted on two-parts. 
											The first part is a participatory design workshop where the youth brainstormed ideas for wellness that informed our design. 
											For the first part, we worked with 27 participants, ages 11-14.
											The second part consisted on field deployment and design interation, where we re-designed the previous application based the youth's 
											ideas and feedback sessions. For the second part we worked with 35 participants between the ages of 11-15 across two states. 
											Youth responded positively to the re-deisgn wearable version in comparison to the previous application, resulting in higher 
											levels of satisfaction and use. 
											They also showed interest in some features for sharing achievements and competitive play, while having the option of mantaining their privacy.
