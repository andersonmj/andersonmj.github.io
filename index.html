										(3) Get teens to use the app (have you asked teens to do something for a long time??)
									How can we co-design a re-design of an app that captures their concept of self-regulation and that youth will use and is engaging?
									</br>
									<strong> Description: </strong></br>
									This project used participatory design methods to explore how wearable devices can support self-regulation among teens, and to redesign the Tenacity meditation-based app to better fit youths’ needs. 
									The project was split into two main parts:Participatory Design Workshop: We collaborated with 27 teens (ages 11-14) from a middle school in Santa Ana, CA, to brainstorm and create tools that aid in self-regulation. The resulting ideas informed the design team’s app redesign process.
									Field Deployment and Design Iteration: The re-designed app was tested in a two-week deployment phase with 35 youth participants (ages 11-15) across two states. Feedback was collected to inform further design iterations. 
									</br>
									<strong> Impact: </strong>
									These findings influenced both the final app design and our approach to youth-centered digital tools. 
									This project contributed to a nuanced understanding of how youth-defined self-regulation can be supported through technology, and it provided key insights into designing privacy-conscious, inclusive wellness tools that respect the needs and interests of young users.
