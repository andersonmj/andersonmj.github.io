										</p>
										
										<p>
											My name is Maria J. Anderson-Coto. I'm currently a postdoctoral associate at the University of Pittsburgh. 
										</p>
										<p>
										<p> I specialize in researching how communities and individuals see themselves reflected in technology and in co-designing tools and initiatives that align with and sustain their unique knowledge, culture, and values.
										As a user-centered researcher with experience in fast-paced, interdisciplinary environments, I focus on creating meaningful, impactful designs by balancing stakeholder needs with the goals of users.
										 I'm interested in areas of human-computer interaction, user-centered design, and community-driven approaches that prioritize cultural relevance and inclusivity.
										</p>
										<p>
											 I hold a PhD in Informatics, and a Bachelor's in Business Administration. 
										</p>
										
										<p> <strong> Skills, Languages, and stuff I might know about:</strong> 
											Qualitative research methods (participatory design, interviews/focus group, field work, usability testing, diary study, survey), analysis techniques (affinity mapping, empathy mapping, thematic analysis, qual coding, descriptive statistics), Figma, Canva, English, Spanish, some Python, Dedoose/research software‚Ä¶
											... I know random facts about cats, am on a mission to visit all the national parks, and have very strong opinions on the best way to make tres leches üç∞.

									<h3> Playful Learning Landscapes companion mobile app </h3>
									<p> <strong> Roles: </strong> UX researcher, qualitative data analyst. </br>
									<strong> Tasks: </strong> Co-facilitated co-design sessions and usability testing, create coding schemes from audio and drawings, transforming them into cultrually sustaining design assets for the app 
										Co-led the coordination and management of five physical installations at parks, grocery stores, and bus stops in collaboration with stakeholders, including researchers, designers, artists, contractors, community members, and City of Santa Ana officials. 		
										Additionally, co-created prototypes for the physical installations, gave feedback on wireframes and prototypes of the phone app, and created layout for the main website.</br>

									<strong>Description:</strong>
										This Project is an extension of the larger *Playful Learning Landscapes* initiative, which reimagines public spaces as interactive learning hubs for STEM education through play. 
										Through community-based, participatory design research and collaboration with the Santa Ana Early Learning Initiative (SAELI), we are co-designing a mobile app that enhances interaction with these installations‚Äîboth on-site and online. 
										This app not only deepens engagement for children completing the activities in person but also makes our activities accessible to children who cannot physically visit the installations
										Right now, we are creating prototypes that reflect children's values, and the communtiy's ways of knowing and being. </br>
									<strong> Impact:</strong> 
										Our work with the Santa Ana community has fostered a democratic design process, amplifying community voices, and promoting pride and ownership in the community. 
										Through public installations like an I-Spy-style mural at a school, supermarket signage, and a bust stop abacus inspired by community stories of immigration, education, and intergenerational STEM knowledge, we‚Äôve created meaningful community-based resources. 
										Upcoming installations include a life-size "How Tall Am I", a game board, and more community-centered murals</br>

									<h3>Youth Connections for Wellbeing</h3>
									<p><strong> Role: </strong> Researcher, Faciliator, Curriculum co-creator and Design instructor </br>
									<strong> Tasks: </strong> I co-designed the structure of the program, the curriculum, and co-faciliated the sessions where we taught and co-designed alongside Latine youth. I also co-created the interview protocol and executed interviews.</br>
									<strong> Methods: </strong> Participatory design, semi-strucured interviews, participant observation, culturally sustaining pedagogy, counterstory, qualitative data analysis </br>
									<strong> Stakeholders: </strong> UC Irvine, ListoAmerica Clubhouse, HCI reserachers and educators, 11 youth, Pivotal Ventures</br>
									<strong> Challenge: </strong> Explore Latine's youth intersectional relationships between wellness and technology. What would a tool/idea that is tailored for their wellness and context look like? </br>
									<p><strong> Description </strong> </br>
									<p> Youth Connections for Wellbeing is a multi-stage project that explores youth's insights, agency, and technology engagements to support their wellbeing.
										Our stage focused on a participatory design project oriented towards teen digital wellness
										The curriculum is based on concepts of cultural responsiveness and community based design, and covered topics such as technology design techniques, 
										wellness, and cognitive behavioral principles. 
										We worked and learned with Latinx teenagers, ages 11-22, co-designing tools for wellness using counter storytelling, and culturally susatining design. </br>
									<p> <strong> Impact: </strong> 
										The program empowered Latine youth to articulate and design for their wellness needs, fostering agency and ownership over their wellbeing. 
										By developing and presenting wellness tools, the youth highlighted critical themes such as community and inclusion, which are informing our approach to future youth wellness tools and culturally sustaining design. 
										Our pivot to an online format due to COVID-19 also yielded key insights into virtual engagement strategies that we are sharing as best practices for remote research and design.</br>

									<h3>Tenacity</h3>
									<p></p><strong> Role: </strong> UX Researcher, facilitator, and qualitative data analysis.</br>
									<strong>Tasks:</strong> I coordinated a team of 8 graduate students and design interns. I co-designed and executed the interview porotocol, diary study, and surveys. 
										Analyzed qualiative data from diary studies, interviews/focus groups and provided design insights and feedback. 
										Tested each design before release, and supervised topics of inclusion and cultural awareness in design. </br>
									<strong> Methods:</strong> participatory design, semi-structured interviews/focus groups, diary studies, surveys, qualitative data analysis </br>
									<strong> Stakeholders: </strong> University of California, Irvine, School in Santa Ana, CA, HCI reserachers and educators, teen youth, NSF, middle and high school teachers </br>
									<strong> Challenge: </strong> How do youth in early adolescence conceptualize self-regulation? 
									How can we co-design a re-design of an app that captures their concept of self-regulation and that youth will use and is engaging?
									</br>
									<strong> Description: </strong></br>
									<p> This project used participatory design methods to explore how wearable devices can support self-regulation among teens, and to redesign the Tenacity meditation-based app to better fit youths‚Äô needs. 
										The project was split into two main parts:Participatory Design Workshop: We collaborated with 27 teens (ages 11-14) from a middle school in Santa Ana, CA, to brainstorm and create tools that aid in self-regulation. The resulting ideas informed the design team‚Äôs app redesign process.
										Field Deployment and Design Iteration: The re-designed app was tested in a two-week deployment phase with 35 youth participants (ages 11-15) across two states. Feedback was collected to inform further design iterations. 
									</br>
									</p>
									
									<strong> Impact: </strong>
										These findings influenced both the final app design and our approach to youth-centered digital tools. 
										This project contributed to a nuanced understanding of how youth-defined self-regulation can be supported through technology, and it provided key insights into designing privacy-conscious, inclusive wellness tools that respect the needs and interests of young users.
